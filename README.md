# BootTodo

**A simple yet powerful C# console diary that automatically syncs your daily to-do list to a Google Doc upon startup.**

BootTodo is designed for those who want to start their day with focus. As soon as you turn on your computer, this app can launch, prompt you for your daily plan, and save it both locally and to a centralized Google Doc. It's the perfect, frictionless way to build a daily logging habit.

## üìã Prerequisites

-   [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later.
-   A [Google Account](https://www.google.com/).

## üöÄ Setup & Configuration

This setup involves creating a simple "middleman" using Google Apps Script. This script will receive data from the C# app and add it to your Google Doc.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BootTodo.git
cd BootTodo
```

### 2. Configure Google Docs & Apps Script

#### A. Create a Google Doc and get the Document ID

1.  Go to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) and create a new, blank document. Name it something like "My Daily Log".
2.  Look at the URL in your browser. It will look like this:
    `https://docs.google.com/document/d/`**`1aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ_12345AbCdEfGhIjK`**`/edit`
3.  The **Document ID** is the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`. Copy this ID. You'll need it soon.

#### B. Create the Google Apps Script

1.  Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and click **"+ New project"**.
2.  Give the project a name, like "BootTodo Syncer".
3.  Delete all the default code in the editor and **paste the entire script below**:

    ```javascript
    // ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ PASTE YOUR DOCUMENT ID HERE ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
    const DOC_ID = "PASTE_THE_DOCUMENT_ID_YOU_COPIED_IN_STEP_A";

    // This function will be called when our C# app sends a request.
    function doPost(e) {
      try {
        const textToAppend = e.parameter.text;
        
        if (!textToAppend) {
          return ContentService.createTextOutput("Error: 'text' parameter is missing.");
        }
        
        const doc = DocumentApp.openById(DOC_ID);
        const body = doc.getBody();
        
        // Append the text from the C# app as a new paragraph.
        body.appendParagraph(textToAppend);
        
        // Return a success message back to the C# app.
        return ContentService.createTextOutput("Success");
        
      } catch (error) {
        return ContentService.createTextOutput("Error: " + error.toString());
      }
    }
    ```
4.  Replace `"PASTE_THE_DOCUMENT_ID_YOU_COPIED_IN_STEP_A"` with the actual Document ID from the previous step.
5.  Click the **Save project** (üíæ) icon.

#### C. Deploy the Script as a Web App to get your URL

1.  In the Apps Script editor, click the blue **"Deploy"** button in the top-right corner and select **"New deployment"**.
2.  Click the **gear icon** (‚öôÔ∏è) next to "Select type" and choose **"Web app"**.
3.  Configure the settings as follows:
    -   **Description:** `BootTodo Syncer` (optional)
    -   **Execute as:** **Me** (your Google account)
    -   **Who has access:** **Anyone**
4.  Click **"Deploy"**.
5.  A window will pop up asking for authorization. Click **"Authorize access"**.
6.  Choose your Google account. You will see a "Google hasn‚Äôt verified this app" warning. This is normal for personal scripts.
7.  Click **"Advanced"**, then click **"Go to [Your Project Name] (unsafe)"**.
8.  Click **"Allow"** on the final screen to grant the script permission to edit your Google Docs.
9.  Finally, a **Web app URL** will be displayed. **Copy this URL.** This is the secret link your C# application will use.

### 3. Configure the C# Application

1.  Open the cloned project in your code editor.
2.  Navigate to the `GoogleDocsManager.cs` file.
3.  Find the following line and paste the **Web app URL** you just copied:

    ```csharp
    private static readonly string AppScriptUrl = "PASTE_YOUR_WEB_APP_URL_HERE";
    ```

### 4. Build and Run

You are now ready to go!

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

## üöÄ Making the App Start Automatically

To get the full "MorningTodo" experience, you should set the app to launch automatically when your computer starts. Here‚Äôs how to do it.

### Step 1: Publish the Application

First, you need to create a standalone, optimized version of the app. Open your terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained
```

This command will create a `publish` folder inside `bin/Release/netX.X/`. This folder contains the executable file (`MorningTodo.exe` on Windows, `MorningTodo` on macOS) and all its dependencies.

### Step 2: Set Up Autostart for Your OS

Now, follow the instructions for your operating system.

#### For Windows 

We'll use the Startup folder, which is the easiest method.

1.  Press the **`Win + R`** keys to open the **Run** dialog box.
2.  Type `shell:startup` and press **Enter**. This will open the Startup folder in File Explorer.
3.  Navigate to the `publish` folder that was created in Step 1 (e.g., `.../MorningTodo/bin/Release/net8.0/publish/`).
4.  Right-click on the **`MorningTodo.exe`** file and select **"Create shortcut"**.
5.  Drag and drop this newly created shortcut into the Startup folder you opened in step 2.

That's it! The next time you log in to Windows, MorningTodo will start automatically.

#### For macOS

We'll add the application to your Login Items.

1.  Open **System Settings** (on macOS Ventura or newer) or **System Preferences** (on older versions).
2.  Go to **General** > **Login Items** (on newer macOS) or **Users & Groups** > **Login Items** tab (on older macOS).
3.  Click the plus (`+`) button under the list of applications.
4.  A file dialog will appear. Navigate to the `publish` folder that was created in Step 1.
5.  Select the **`MorningTodo`** executable file (it will not have a `.exe` extension) and click **"Add"**.

The application will now appear in the list and will launch automatically whenever you log in.
